Object hierarchy.
I want to have many properties describing objects of surrounding world.
There are visible, but statical objects.
There are visible and dynamical objects.
There are invisible objects, that have an influance on other objects.

One entity - many properties.

So, algorithm:
    initialize state;
    forever:
	poll outer world events;
	     process each event;
	for each object in world:
	     according to events and previous world state
	     process object's new state:
	     	     detect collisions;    <--|
	     	     update postions;	 <----|
		     update inner states;  <--+--- so, properties
		     update logics	 <----|
		     process animation     <--|
		     and so forth  	 <----|
		     
		     
	render all scene;
	
    cleanup;

    for each property of entity: 
    	call Update method on Logic
	call Render method on Renderable


properties may be:
	   --> Renderable
	   --> Physical
	   --> Dynamic
	   --> Collisionable (Rigid body, I think?)
	   --> Logics
